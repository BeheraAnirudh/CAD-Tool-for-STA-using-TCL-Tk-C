# CAD-Tool-for-STA-using-TCL-Tk-C

This Library contains a project based on designing a CAD Tool using TCL/Tk programming and Programming C to find out Static Timing Analysis based on user inputs.

# STA
STA folder contains only C code which can find the Static Timing Analysis from given set of inputs.

# CAD Tool
CAD Tool folder contains modified TCL program which gives the GUI structure, where my structured spanning tree with respective nodes can be represented. Input values can be assigned to every nodes and based on all node inputs the designed C code will find the STA and it can be represented on GUI screen.
 
# Output Screenshorts
After exicuting the given inputs i got, Arrival time, Required time, Slack value with respect to their nodes which are then shown in the GUI window. Screenshorts are attached for reference.


# TCL/TK IDE and C-program IDE is required for exicution.
